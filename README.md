# EHRtemporalVariability-shiny

`EHRtemporalVariability-shiny` is an R Shiny app for delineating temporal dataset shifts in Eletronic Health Records. This app uses and complements the R `EHRtemporalVariability` package (https://github.com/hms-dbmi/EHRtemporalVariability).

## What is this repository for?

The `EHRtemporalVariability-shiny` R Shiny app provides a graphical user interface to delineate temporal dataset shifts in Electronic Health Records through the projection and visualization of differences among data temporal batches. This is done through the estimation of data statistical distributions over time and their projection in non-parametric statistical manifolds uncovering the patterns of the data latent temporal variability. Results can be explored through visual analytics formats such as Data Temporal heatmaps and Information Geometric Temporal (IGT) plots [1,2,3]. The supporting [EHRtemporalVariability R package](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/EHRtemporalVariability) can be used for more detailed and personalized analysis by users experienced in R coding.

Note that there are two shiny app R files:

* __EHRtemporalVariabilityShinyAppForLocalUse.R__: Besides the embedded demo and the loading of .RData files, it includes the loading and processing of csv files with raw data at individual level.
* __EHRtemporalVariabilityShinyAppForPublicUse.R__: It does not include the csv functionality.

## On line demo

An on line demo of the EHRtemporalVariability shiny app is available at http://ehrtemporalvariability.upv.es/
